# Our approach to JoCoKnow

## Determining the technology

The key requirements for our technology choices are open source, FAIR principles of use, strong community support of the technology, and automation capable. Patrick Gale is an expert in the following technologies that were chosen for our approach to the implementation of this project.

### Dataverse data repository and archive

Patrick has reviewed and tested various data repository software for years, but the Dataverse most extensively since UNC hosts and supports a local installation of the software and Patrick's work with the developers of the software at Harvard University. Our approach to using the Dataverse is primarily through the software API to enable automated deposit and retrieval of data. The automation allows for reuse of scripts, when combined with the management of large numbers of datasets becomes a necessity for efficiency and quality control.

### Jupyter notebook scripting framework

We also realize that few archives.

### JSON metadata

### Plain formatted text data tables

### Docusaurus documentation framework

### GitHub code repository

The project proposal will establish a foundational knowledge base to facilitate the transition of the Johnston County studies from researcher-driven investigations to a standardized resource. To achieve this, 

 (D.2.1 and D.2.2). 
 
 The procedure leverages reusable automated components across datasets to accelerate the efficiency and excellence of data curation (D.2.3). This resou
