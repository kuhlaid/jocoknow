# Jupyter notebooks

This is likely the best tool to have in your data curation toolbox. A Jupyter notebook is not only the visual eye candy for representing your metadata, but it provides you with the tools to download and work with much of the data. This is significant because we can run data analyses from within the notebook and save the results and notes from those analyses within a single file. The best thing about these notebooks is they are JSON formatted (you will notice we talk at great lengths about JSON in this guide). In this knowledge guide we will provide you with examples and demonstrate the power of these notebooks.

## Best practices

For beginners to Jupyter notebooks, there are few guides on best practices on how to format a notebook. There are simply markdown cells and scripting cells that you fill with your notes and code. Keeping all of your information embedded within the notebook however can present problems. From the coding side it does not provide you with a method of 'script reuse'. It also can cause a notebook to become overly bloated with long blocks of scripts that distract from the overall notebook function which is usually to present results or describe something.

In our notebooks, we elevate the coding experience with a 'script once and use many times' approach which separates the core notebook code from the notebook itself. The approach reduces the scrolling required to navigate a notebook.
