- [x] adding a basic `cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local` search plugin (needs configuration changes but is a good starter search tool)

## [x.x.x] - future ideas

- [ ] try to query the Dataverse API to retrieve a list of datasets to help autogenerate a dataset listing README file that links to the individual README and curation files for each dataset (remove dataset `_category_.json` file and replace with this)
- [ ] create a jupyter notebook similar to the README generator that will pull dataset data from the Dataverse for a specified DOI and Dataverse alias, so API-users can select the datasets they want to download instead of doing it manually; maybe save the downloaded datasets to DOI directories then maybe include code to link datasets together; create a simple JS page that lists all datasets so users can check the datasets they want and an autogenerated DOI list will be created for them that they can then copy into their Jupyter notebook configuration for specifying which datasets to download
- [ ] write instructions on how to link this documentation site builder with the Jupyter notebooks used for dataset curation to publish the curation logs to this site under dataset specific directories/pages (using shutil commands to copy files from the notebook directories to this site builder)
- [ ] add Algolia search once the site is production ready and write up a document regarding how users can best search for data
- [ ] write a document which contains the code and resources to build a curation log generator and how it compares to the curation log for https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/SKP9IB
- [ ] `cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local` search plugin needs better configuration
- [ ] local search linking to pages such as `https://jocoknow.vercel.app/docs/jocoknow-extras/translate-your-site/docs/jocoknow-extras/translate-your-site#translate-a-doc` which do not exist
- [ ] add resources for developing data management plan (https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) and data curation logs
- [ ] add a template for logging data curation steps
- [ ] write instructions for a curation log example using JSON and code to parse the file into Markdown; include methods for adding ToDo items to the log to help encourage users to make use of the log; add ability to include question or checklist types to a curation task **IMPORTANT**
